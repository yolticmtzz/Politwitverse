He said he had been \u201cinvolved in state policy development at the national level for quite some time\u201d and realized \u201cthe best way to continue these efforts over the long term is to step down from public office and continue my efforts within the private sector.

His departure, along with the expected resignation of Rep. Aaron Griesheimer of Washington, will take Republicans below the two-thirds majority necessary in the House to immediately enact a new map of the state\u2019s eight congressional districts, increasing reliance on Democratic votes.")
