This afternoon, I met with members of my COVID-19 Response Team to discuss the Omicron variant and our efforts to combat it.

The meat industry is a textbook example. Today, I met with independent farmers and ranchers to discuss how we’re working to level the playing field for them — while lowering prices for American families. https://t.co/oTUZeQQlqGGet vaccinated and get boosted.

That’s the largest increase in recorded history.Last year at this time, there were 823,000 Americans filing new jobless claims each week.
